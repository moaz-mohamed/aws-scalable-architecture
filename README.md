# Scalable, Highly Available and Secure AWS Infrastructure
- This project showcases a **Sclalable, Highly Available and Secure Cloud Infrastructure** built on **AWS** using **Terraform** (First Method) and **AWS Management Console** (Second Method). 
- It utilizes various AWS services such as Route 53, VPC, EC2, RDS, ALB, Auto Scaling, WAF, Cloudwatch, SNS and more to create a robust infrastructure.  
- It implements a **two-tier architecture**‚Äîa scalable web tier using EC2 Auto Scaling, and a data tier using Amazon RDS (MySQL). 
- A Flask web app is deployed to demonstrate the functionality of the infrastructure.


## üåê Architecture Overview

- The infrastructure is deployed in a single VPC spanning  **two Availability Zones (AZs)** within the **AWS Region** to ensure high availability and fault tolerance.
- It includes public subnets (for ALB, NAT Gateway, Bastion Host) and private subnets (for EC2 Auto Scaling instances and RDS). 
- Traffic flows securely from Route 53 ‚Üí ALB ‚Üí private EC2 instances ‚Üí RDS instance, with outbound internet access via the NAT Gateway.

##  key Components

| Component | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| **Route 53** | Acts as the DNS service to route user traffic to the Application Load Balancer (ALB) |
| **VPC** | Custom Virtual Private Cloud with public and private subnets across two AZ for high availability |
| **Public Subnets** | Hosts the ALB, NAT Gateway, and Bastion Host for secure SSH access |
| **Private Subnets** | Hosts EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling Group and Amazon RDS database |
| **Internet Gateway (IGW)** | Provides internet access to public subnets |
| **NAT Gateway** | Allows EC2 instances in private subnets to access the internet (e.g., for package installs) |
| **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** | Public-facing, distributes traffic to EC2 instances in private subnets and performs health checks |
| **Target Groups** | Groups EC2 instances for the ALB to route traffic to |
| **Auto Scaling Group (ASG)** | Automatically adjusts the number of EC2 instances based on demand, ensuring scalability and fault tolerance |
| **Launch Template** | Defines the configuration for EC2 instances in the ASG, including AMI, instance type, security group, and key pair |
| **AMI** | Custom Amazon Machine Image created from a pre-configured EC2 instance with the Flask app installed |
| **Flask App** | CRUD application running as systemd service on EC2 instances, retrieves database credentials from AWS Secrets Manager and connects to RDS |
| **EC2 Instances** | Act as the web server (Hosts the Flask web app, launched via AMI) |
| **Amazon RDS (MySQL, Multi-AZ)** | Managed relational database with automatic failover across AZs |
| **AWS WAF** | Attached to the ALB for additional protection against commmon web attacks |
| **AWS Secrets Manager** | Secure storage of database credentials used by the Flask app |
| **Bastion Host** |  Jump server in a public subnet for secure SSH access to private EC2 instances |
| **IAM Roles & Policies** |  Secure access control for EC2, RDS, and monitoring services, ensures least-privilege access |
| **CloudWatch** | Monitors metrics and triggers alarms on failures of any ALB targets |
| **SNS** | Sends notifications (email alerts) to DevOps engineers upon alarm triggers |

## Deployment Steps
 
### Prerequisites
- AWS account with necessary permissions to create resources.
- Terraform installed on your local machine.
- AWS CLI configured with your credentials.
- An SSH key pair created for accessing the Bastion Host.
- Change the `key_name` variable in modules/asg/variables.tf to your SSH key pair name.
- Create an AMI from a temporary EC2 instance with your application installed and configured.
- Change the `flask_ami_id` variable in modules/asg/variables.tf to the AMI ID you created.
  
### Steps to Deploy
1. Clone the repo and run
   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```
2. Set environment variables for RDS credentials
      ```bash
   export TF_VAR_db_username="your_db_username" # Set your RDS username
   export TF_VAR_db_password="your_db_password" # Set your RDS password
   ```
   Or enter value when prompted during `terraform apply`

   Or you can create a `terraform.tfvars` file that contains the varaibles

3. Run the following commands to deploy the infrastructure
   ```bash
   terraform plan # Review the plan before applying
   terraform apply
   ```

4. Wait for the resources to be created. After successful creation, you will see the ALB DNS name in the output, use it to access the Flask app from the browser.

5. Destroy the infrastructure when done
    ```bash
    terraform destroy 
    ```

## Implementation Steps using AWS Management Console (Second Method)

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Networking Setup
- Created a custom VPC across two Availability Zones.
- Created **public subnets** for ALB, NAT Gateway, and Bastion Host.
- Created **private subnets** for EC2 app servers and RDS database.
- Attached an **Internet Gateway (IGW)** to the VPC for external connectivity.
- Created a **NAT Gateway** in a public subnet to enable private EC2 instances to access the internet securely.
- Configured route tables to ensure proper traffic flow between components.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Security Setup
- Created security groups:
  - **ALB SG**: allows inbound HTTP (port 80) from the internet.
  - **EC2 SG**: allows HTTP only from ALB SG.
  - **RDS SG**: allows MySQL (port 3306) only from EC2 SG.
  - **Bastion SG**: allows SSH (port 22) from trusted IPs.
- Created an **IAM role** for EC2 instances to access AWS Secrets Manager for DB credentials.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Database Setup
- Deployed an **Amazon RDS MySQL (Multi-AZ)** instance in private subnets.
![RDS](./Images/RDS.png)
- Attached **RDS SG** to allow access from EC2 instances.
- Stored RDS credentials securely in **AWS Secrets Manager**.
![Secrets Manager](./Images/Secrets%20Manager.png)

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ App Server Preparation
- Launched a temporary EC2 instance in a private subnet.
- Installed Flask app, Gunicorn, and configured `systemd` service for auto-start on boot.
- Configured the app to retrieve database credentials from **AWS Secrets Manager**.
- Tested the app locally on port 80.
- Created an **AMI** from this EC2 instance to be used in **ASG Launch Template**.
![AMI](./Images/AMI.png)

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Auto Scaling + ALB
- Created a **Launch Template** using the custom **AMI**.
- Configured the template with:
  - Instance type: `t3.micro`
  - Security group: **EC2 SG**
  - Key pair for SSH access from the Bastion Host.
- Set up an **Auto Scaling Group (ASG)** using this template, with private subnets.
- Target Scaling Policy to scale out/in based on average CPU utilization (target 70%).
![Target Scaling](./Images/Target%20Scaling.png)
- Deployed an **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** in public subnets across two AZs.
- Configured ALB with:
  - HTTP listener on port 80.
  - Target group linked to the ASG.
  - Health checks on `/` to monitor instance health.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Security Hardening
- Attached **AWS WAF** to ALB with rules to block common web attacks (SQL injection, XSS).
![WAF](./Images/WAF.png)

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Bastion Host
- Deployed a **Bastion Host** in a public subnet for secure SSH access to private EC2 instances.

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ Monitoring + Notifications
- Configured **CloudWatch alarm** to trigger when the ALB has unhealthy hosts.
![CloudWatch Alarm](./Images/Cloudwatch%20Alarm.png)
- Set up an **SNS topic** and subscribed an email address for receiving alerts.
![SNS](./Images/SNS.png)
- Configured the alarm to send notifications to the SNS topic when triggered.
![Alarm Trigger](./Images/Alarm%20Trigger.png)


## üîê Security Considerations

- Web servers are in private subnets ‚Äî not directly accessible from the internet.
- SSH access is restricted via a **Bastion Host** in a public subnet.
- **Security Groups** are configured to allow traffic only from trusted sources.
- **IAM roles** applied to control access to AWS services with least-privilege permissions.
- **AWS WAF** provides an additional layer of security against common web attacks.
- **AWS Secrets Manager** is used to securely store and manage database credentials.
